A collection of queries suitable for sending to the version one query endpoint. May contain data specific to my own situation.  Your mileage may vary.

Meta
----

Don't forget to explore the metadata for your VersionOne instance.  It's normally just baseUrl plus "meta.v1". (You can add a parameter "xsl=api.xsl" to have it come back a little prettier.) For example, the url for my instance is 

    https://www5.v1host.com/FH-V1/meta.v1?xsl=api.xsl
